Q.

Suppose that a demon alters your Move-To-Front algorithm so that it moves a key to the end of the list each time it is accessed. Express the expected number of comparisons to find a key under this "MoveTo-End" Heuristic in terms of the access probabilities of the keys in the list.

A.

It is same as C_MTF, 1 + 2(sigma i < j p_i*p_j/(p_i + p_j)).
