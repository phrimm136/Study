Q.

a. Write the grade school algorithm for the addition of two nonnegative integers in binary notation.
The algorithm should take as arguments two tables of bits, not necessarily of the same length,
and return a table of bits one longer than the length of its longer input.

b. Show that this algorithm runs in time linear in the length of the longer of its arguments.

c. Repeat parts (a) and (b) for subtraction of two integers.
Assume that the value of the first argument is greater than or equal to the
value of the second argument, so that there is no possibility of producing a negative answer.

d. Write the procedure Accum(A[O..m-1], B[0..n-1]),
which adds the value represented by A into the table B.
(You may assume that n > m and that overflow is impossible.)

A.

a.

function BinaryAdd(table B1[0..n-1], table B2[0..m-1]): table
{Add two binary tables and return the result}
    C <- 0
    S <- 0
    if n-1 > m-1 then
        Ltable <- B1
	Stable <- B2
    else
        Ltable <- B2
	Stable <- B1
    for i from 0 to min(n-1, m-1) do
        S <- Ltable[i] + Stable[i] + C
	sum[i] <- S % 2
	C <- S / 2
    for i from o to min(n, m) do
        S <- Ltable[i] + C
	sum[i] <- S % 2
	c <- S / 2
    return sum

b.

Comparing the longer table takes constant time.
Adding Stable to Ltable takes k_1*min(n-1,m-1) and assigning the rest elements of Ltable takes k_2*(max(n-1,m-1) - min(n-1,m-1)) time.
The sum of time is C + k_2*max(n-1,m-1) + (k_1-k_2)*min(n-1,m-2), but n-1 and m-2 is linear, so this algorithm runs in time linear in the length of the longer of its arguments.

c.

function BinarySub(table B1[0..n-1, tableB2[0..m-1]): table
{Substract two binary tables and return the result. B1 is always larger than B2.}
    D <- 0
    diff[m..n-1] <- B1[m..n-1]
    for i from n-1 to m do
        D <- B1[i]
    for i from m-1 to 0 do
        D <- B1[i] - B2[i]
    for i from 0 to n-1 do
        if diff[i] < 0 then
	    diff[i+1] = doff[i+1] - 1
	    diff[i] = diff[i] + 2
    return diff

Assigning the longer part to diff takes k_1*(n-m) time, and substracting two tables takes k_2(m) time.
So the total time is k_1*n + (k_2-k_1)*m, which is linear in the length of the longer of its arguments.

d.

procedure BinaryAccum(table A[0..m-1], table B[0..n-1]):
{Add the value represented by A into B. B is always longer than A}
    for i from 1 to m-1 do
        B[i] <- A[i] + B[i]
	if B[i] > 1 then
	    B[i+1] = B2[i+1] + 1
	    B[i] = B[i] - 2
