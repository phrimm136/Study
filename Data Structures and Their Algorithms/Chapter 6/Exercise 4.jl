Q.

'Zipf's law' for the probability distribution of a set of items states that the ith most frequently occurring item occurs with probability proportional to 1/i. That is, there is a constant c such that if K_1, ..., K_n are the keys in order of decreasing frequency, then the frequency of K_i is c/i.
(This law is a reasonably accurate model for the frequency of occurrence of words in the English language.)
If the keys obey Zipf's law, what is the expected number of comparisons to find a key in a list of size n ordered by frequency?

A.

(sigma i from 1 to n i*c/i) = cn
