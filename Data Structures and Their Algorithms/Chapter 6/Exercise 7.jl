Q.

A linked representation, rather than a tabular representation,
saves time when rearranging items if the Move-to-Front Heuristic is used.
But it costs memory; how might the extra memory be better utilized
by a different heuristic?

A.

In table, Transpose Heuristic is proper since extra memory for an temporary variable to swap elements is needed.
